## Problem Statement

Interns relocating to San Francisco face overwhelming challenges in finding compatible roommates, navigating unfamiliar neighborhoods, and discovering local professional and social opportunities. Without access to a community of peers facing similar relocation challenges, they miss out on valuable connections that could enhance their career development and city experience.

## Description

The main purpose of our project is to create a web platform that helps interns and early-career professionals successfully integrate into San Francisco's professional and social landscape. Our site offers three key functionalities: roommate matching, neighborhood exploration with safety and budget information, and event discovery throughout the city. 

Our targeted audience of interns and early-career professionals will use the website to create verified profiles, browse and match with potential roommates based on compatibility factors, explore SF neighborhoods with detailed information about safety, cost, and amenities, discover events throughout the city, participate in community forums, and sync networking events directly to their personal calendars for easy planning.


## Expected Features List
- Login/User Registration
- User profile creation with school, work, background, and fun facts
- Events Discovery Page (AI TLDR of Events)
- Roomate/Neighborhood Finder and Information Portal
- Community forum and discussion boards

## Related Work
Similar apps and websites:
- Bumble BFF: Social networking for friendships, but lacks housing and professional focus
- SpareRoom/Roomi: Roommate finding apps, but missing community and professional networking elements
- Meetup/Eventbrite: Event discovery platforms, but not tailored to interns or early-career professionals
- Facebook Groups: Intern housing groups exist but lack verification, matching algorithms, and integrated neighborhood information

Our project stands out by:
- Combining roommate matching, neighborhood exploration, and professional networking in one platform
- Focusing specifically on the intern/early-career demographic with verification through work/school emails
- Providing San Francisco-specific neighborhood insights and safety information
- Offering AI-curated event recommendations tailored to career development
- Creating a trusted community through email verification and peer reviews

## Open Questions

- How can we effectively verify users while maintaining privacy and security?
- What specific neighborhood data points are most valuable for intern decision-making?
- How can we ensure our web scraping for events complies with website terms of service?
- What matching algorithm criteria will be most effective for roommate compatibility?
- How to properly implement AI into our events features
