## Problem Statement and Description

### Problem Statement
Interns relocating to new cities face overwhelming challenges in finding compatible roommates, navigating unfamiliar neighborhoods, and discovering local professional and social opportunities. Without access to a community of peers facing similar relocation challenges, they miss out on valuable connections that could enhance their career development and city experience.

### Description
The main purpose of our project is to create a web platform that helps interns and early-career professionals successfully integrate into a new city's landscape. Our site offers three key functionalities: roommate matching, neighborhood exploration with relevant safety and budget information, and event discovery.

Our users will be able to create verified profiles, browse and match with potential roommates based on compatibility factors, explore local neighborhoods with detailed information, and discover relevant events. 

## User Roles and Personas

### User Roles
Intern: College student or recent graduate temporarily relocating for internships

### User Personas
Carmen is a rising junior at Harvard that will be interning at Real Company© as a Software Engineering intern in San Francisco. Carmen has already found other students to room with over the summer, but she’s never been off the east coast. As a result she’s feeling overwhelmed and isn’t sure what to do or where to go to make the most of her summer

Ace is a sophomore at UIUC that comes from a very small town where he struggles to meet new people. This upcoming summer, Ace will be a growth strategist intern at Real Company©. He’s very excited about the opportunity but with San Francisco’s expensive rent, Ace will only be able to afford housing if he has 1-2 roommates. Ace wants to make sure that he has a place to stay with clean and respectful roommates that he’s compatible with.
