## Problem Statement

Interns relocating to San Francisco face overwhelming challenges in finding compatible roommates, navigating unfamiliar neighborhoods, and discovering local professional and social opportunities. Without access to a community of peers facing similar relocation challenges, they miss out on valuable connections that could enhance their career development and city experience.

## User Roles

Intern: College student or recent graduate temporarily relocating to San Francisco for internships

## User Personas

- Carmen is a rising junior at Harvard that will be interning at Real Company© as a Software Engineering intern in San Francisco. Carmen has already found other students to room with over the summer, but she’s never been off the east coast. As a result she’s feeling overwhelmed and isn’t sure what to do or where to go to make the most of her summer

- Ace is a sophomore at UIUC that comes from a very small town where he struggles to meet new people. This upcoming summer, Ace will be a growth strategist intern at Real Company©. He’s very excited about the opportunity but with San Francisco’s expensive rent, Ace will only be able to afford housing if he has 1-2 roommates. Ace wants to make sure that he has a place to stay with clean and respectful roommates that he’s compatible with.

## User Stories

1. As a newly registered user, I want to be able to customize my profile to reflect my interests with photos/fun facts, what school I go to, and the company I will be interning at so that other users can get to know me better. 
2. As a potential new user, I want to ensure I am signing up for a website that has verified users that are interning in SF so that I know I am interacting with real people.
3. As an intern, I want to be able to browse and discover events in the surrounding area so that I can find more opportunities to connect with other people
4. As a busy intern, I want to be able to view a weekly/daily roundup of upcoming events I may be interested in so that I don’t have to look through a long list of events.
5. As a newcomer to SF, I want to be able to meet new people that share my similar interests so that I can explore potential new roommates.
6. As a user looking for roommates, I want to be able to message another user so that I can get to know them better. 
7. As a registered user excited to explore the Bay Area, I want to be able to create/join discussion boards so that I can meet new people and explore what’s happening in SF.
8. As an intern, I want to explore and compare information about neighborhoods I’m interested in such as walk scores, public transit access and crime rates so I can make an informed decision about where to live during my internship. 
9. As an intern, I want to read reviews other verified users have left about neighborhoods they have lived in before so that I can read past user experiences to make a more informed decision about where to live during my internship.
10. As a user that has just finished my internship, I want to be able to delete my profile so that I don’t have my information stored anywhere.
