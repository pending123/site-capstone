## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to really bring together our individual portions to make our application more cohesive. The most successful thing was definitely the newly implemented messaging feature. It really brings together our application.
* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

The biggest challenge we faced was definitely making sure that everything was done on time. We were definitely in a bit of a rush to make sure we had everything done before we demo'd during the bug bash and it forced us to prioritize certain things and put other things in the backseat until we could get to them later.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished a good portion of our tasks in our sprint planning but a few things we weren't able to get to before the code freeze and we'll work on over the weekend and finish up on monday.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Trello has been a significant help during every sprint when it came to organizing our workload and understanding how far each of us in the pod were with our work
* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The forums section seems most at risk but that's because it was originally created as a backup if our real time chat couldn't be implemented. So now that we have messaging in our application we felt that our time could be spent on more important things.
