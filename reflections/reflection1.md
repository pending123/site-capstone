## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Our communication this week helped make every push and pull seamless. We also did extensive testing to make sure everything works. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 There were some challenges with testing the profile and events page, but we ultimately fixed the bugs once we merged our changes. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we finished all of our sprint plan for this week and got started on next week's tasks which is mainly focused on front-end.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes. We met with our mentors and they connected us with a UI/UX designer on their team who gave us a lot of helpful resources for next week's sprint plan. The Clerk Docs also helped a lot with webhook testing and backend implementation.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

No.
